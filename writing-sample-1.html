						<u>Author’s note:</u><br>
					</p>
					
					<p style="font-size: 2.5rem;">
						Written as an experimental piece about mental illness, I wanted to explore the topics of anxiety and suicide in a subtle and experiential way, one that doesn’t outline the horrors or turmoil that comes with such experiences and thoughts that I believe many other stories have done before. Rather, I wanted to write with a sense of beauty and mental growth that often opposes the typical thoughts, and to create a sense of emotional ambiguity until the very end where the actual decision is revealed. I in no way advocate for suicide and simply accepting such mental struggles as futile—if anything, I wholly believe in the opposite. But with that in mind, please enjoy the story.

					<h5><u>Story:</u></h5>
					<p>
						The ocean, at high tide and early dusk. The sharp saltiness and rough sand were all new experiences. The beach lay nearly empty as I stepped out alone through the cold winter air and greeted the breaking coast with my bare feet. I closed my eyes and let the crashing waves attempt to overtake the loudness of my own mind. The waves—my past. The ocean—myself. And then, the sudden splash of ice-cold waves rushing past my feet snapped me back to the shore, and as I started to jump backwards, I was reminded of the voice the ocean had pulled me away from. And so I took in the salty air and planted a foot firmly in the path of water that lay before me.<br><br>

						The sky is now casting red and orange. The water wrapped around my feet, cold yet amazingly refreshing—new intense feelings that were both foreign and welcome. I continued my march, wading further and further into the open waves. Far past the break point, the water now met my waist. My clothes pulled and restricted me the deeper I walked, begging to find respite back on land in the endless expanse, yet once deep enough, the clothes, too, became familiar and began to float among the waves.<br><br>

						The ocean now reached well past my neck and I could only see the half circle of the sun in front of me. I would now stay above the water by bouncing effortlessly against the bottom. Up and down. Under and above. I felt boundless. And in the silent rocking of the endless sea, I began to laugh. Laughed at the new feeling. Laughed at the forgotten land. Laughed as I continued moving. And I kept laughing—laughing as I now understood that the ocean was laughing with me.<br><br>

						The sun had barely remained visible by the time I could no longer touch any ground, so rather, I floated on my back and stared at the empty mixture of dark blue and slight yellow that filled the sky. I laid down flat in the gentle silence of the sea, uninterrupted and adrift. I closed my eyes and was only greeted by the soft movement of the water, rocking me back and forth. I began to exhale. The water that hugged me so closely continued to wrap my face further and further, until I merged with the familiar cold. I felt the bubbles of the outside air pass through lips, rushing out to join the surface, and in its place, the ocean found its way inside, embracing no different than water around me. I open my eyes yet again, able to see the final shimmers of the sun dimming on the surface. And as the light recedes its last beckon, I find myself—at last—truly weightless.<br><br>

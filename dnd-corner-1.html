						<u>Preface:</u><br>
					</p>
					
					<p style="font-size: 2.5rem;">
						Written as a self-contained and complete story arc, this narrative contains an NPC and unique monsters and mechanics made exclusively for this adventure. Each introduction, be it the overall arc’s introduction or the chapter introduction, is written beforehand to ensure and establish consistency to the narrative’s flow, yet beyond the introduction, the flow is let open to allow for the players progress naturally. Alongside the established narrative lead-ins, encounter charts are made in theme to the area to ensure flavour but not become planned.
					</p>
					
					<h5><u>Chapter 1—Maws of Stone:</u></h5>
					<p>
						From an old cave hidden in a forest, there's been sounds of disturbance causing concern. A long standing village, Rokental,  has been concerned with the vitality of themselves and the cave. There have been sightings of animals running into a cave where they never leave, however, more interestingly, there's also been reports of other creatures running out as well; those fabled to have died out long ago— dinosaurs. Only 2 or 3 have been thought to be seen, but that's enough for some to explore their curiosity.<br><br>

						Crazed paleontologist, Ruby Axon, has hired your group to serve as her guards and escort to delve deep into the disturbed cave. Beyond just protecting Ruby, the village has caught wind of your arrival and also tasks you with stopping whatever is causing such chaos. Of course receiving considerable compensation from both.<br><br>

						Now tasked with protecting Ruby and Rokental, you arrive at the village’s humble entrance. The village seems to be calm but somehow on edge. They look upon you with hopeful eyes, wishing that you'd fix the terror that's causing discourse in their happy town. However more pressing things matter right now; Your boss, Ruby, has told you to meet her at a local bistro, Stoneleaf…<br><br>

						(Gameplay)<br><br>

						…The cave’s entrance stands tall before you, it's jaws stretching overhead. The stone is shaped and hardened like scales, damp from the moisture inside. It has a large overhang jutting from a mountain face that has hundreds of stalactites spearing down like teeth. It has two cut skylights on the ceiling parallel near the wall; It’s almost like they were made like eyes on purpose. On the ground around you are rows of stony fangs, mirroring the shape of the roof above you. Looking into the mouth, echoes roar from the darkness.<br><br>

						Racing to the front of your party, Ruby peers down the cave taking in the sight. “Geez! The cave sure lives up to its nickname ‘Eternal Scales’, huh? It looks like a dragon and everything! Or even better—a dinosaur! Honestly, it seems a bit scary— but that’s why I have you guys, right?”<br><br>

						*Encounter sheet for Chapter 1. Uses 2 D6 to determine encounter. Encounters are specially tailored to be a mix of social, adventure, and combat encounters while also being flavoured to the area.
					</p>


					<h5><u>Chapter 2—Crystal Echoes:</u></h5>
					<p>
						As you delve deeper into the cavern, the darkness pounds heavier on your minds. The walls become a sore familiar sight and the glow of the torch being your greatest comfort. At every moment, your mind begs for a way out, but as the pressure weighs heavier and heavier, you see a faint glint break the creeping shadows. You step towards what you think to an opening and your feet follow the path of the cave— downward. The source of light isn't the familiar glow of the sun, but, rather, it comes from depths, towards the heart of the mountain, even deeper into the stony prison you've been traveling.<br><br>

						As you follow the source of this underground light, you discover what feels like a completely different area as the familiar stone slowly transforms to glass like structures. Pools of water gather from what was once simple surface streams, forming a cascade of small springs downward like stairs. The small bowls of water also bond with the stone that holds it, making a magical spa of sorts. However, as each pool emanates  a distinct colour, you can tell that the liquid does much more than simply glow.
					</p>

					<h5><u>Chapter 3—Clash of Evolution:</u></h5>
					<p>
						A tropical haven, formed from a large basin stretching for what seems like miles. Huge natural land bridges span overhead far over your heads and supported by titanic spearing pillars. The layers between the top and bottom are separated by many ramps and bridges from the pillars. Main bridges create a web supported by a huge partial pillar at the very center with an even larger hallowed tree eating at it. The walls of the crater spike up violently, locking whatever inside and keeping whatever out. You can barely see the other wall from one side.<br><br>

						The land seems to eat off the plentiful magic in the ground leading to the animals and plants to have magical properties. The land is completely flourishing and there is no bound to the type of life there. Mainly Inhabited by the dinosaurs, they lead a peaceful and natural life.<br><br>

						However recently intruders have come in and have tried to take over the land—Dragons. Dragons appear to be continuously flying in, as if they have migrated and have dictated this land as the best and only place to roost. The dragons—led by a great red dragon—have started decimating the dinosaurs and the land itself. The dinosaurs—dominated by a great giganotosaurus—are fighting back to keep what is theirs. In the distance, you can sense the fight that could destroy this entire basin is taking place- the leaders are fighting to claim what is theirs. This beautiful haven could be completely lost if this fight goes on, so you must choose: Help the dinosaurs keep their land or help the dragons settle to keep them from migrating somewhere even more dangerous.<br><br>

						<u>Final Boss:</u><br>
						Dragon vs King Dinosaur. They will fight each other, and you must have at least 1 die and can help either in the fight.<br><br>

						<u>NPC Ruby:</u><br>
						Her obsession drives her to be an incredible adventurer but that same obsession holds her back on anything that's not the object of focus. She will do anything to learn more about dinosaurs and their past. She keeps extensive notes and drawings of dinosaurs, hoping to capture what they are like in person. Facing dinosaurs she will stop everything to record what they are like; however facing anything else, she will challenge any obstacle stopping her from her beloved dinosaurs. She has an excitable personality, always wanting to not waste time and act. Compared to her obsession, her care for herself is minimal, always putting herself in danger. She has honed her skills as an adventurer more to expand on her obsession.

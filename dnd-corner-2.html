						<u>Preface:</u><br>
					</p>
					
					<p style="font-size: 2.5rem;">
						Written as an introductory adventure, this unused story arc is written to combine the built environment and the forces of nature. Each introduction, be it the overall arc’s introduction or the chapter introduction, is written beforehand to ensure and establish consistency to the narrative’s flow, yet beyond the introduction, the flow is let open to allow for the players progress naturally. Alongside the established narrative lead-ins, encounter charts are made in theme to the area to ensure flavour but not become planned.
					</p>
					
					<h5><u>Introduction:</u></h5>
					<p>
						A city overcome by wilderness recruits the nearest adventurers to deal with an issue. The old woods “Floser Grove” has been expanding at an alarming rate and it has already taken over the main bustling city of the area “Flos”. The city has been left as a skeleton of its old self with only a few brave people daring to stay in the area on the farthest side. Adventurers are tasked with determining the reason for this unnatural natural growth by the king of the lands in which he is losing territory to live and farm on.<br><br>

						After answering a desperate letter sent to all adventurers in the local kingdom, you group of (X) were the only ones brave enough, capable enough, and the only ones free enough to take on the plea. The local woods, now nicknamed the “Forest of the Consumed”, has been expanding at an incredible rate and nearly doubling its size. The forest is now feared by locals as many who go in seem to disappear—“consumed” by the forest within the ever living aura of the woods. The forest has taken over the large trade city of “Flos” and is still spreading. You are now tasked with finding the source of this unnatural phenomenon and bringing stability to the land.
					</p>

					<h5><u>Chapter 1— Roots of Despair:</u></h5>
					<p>
						Upon reaching the grand iron gates of the city Flos, you hear faint movement and chatter behind the bars. As you get closer, the noise—a faint whisper in comparison to the normal bustle of the trade center—grows louder. You push open the gate, shrieking a newly rusted creak, to reveal a mostly abandoned city, appearing old and forgotten, however the reality being, that this was all new. The inhabitants appear to be those left brave enough— or at least those who had no choice but to stay—  in the recently run-down buildings, keeping mostly to this one corner on this far side of the city. You see that mostly all the buildings have large vines, roots, trees, tendrils, and vegetation completely consuming the structures, some structures falling and being partially eaten by nature's power. You are able to see looking further in, that the plants have a more commanding and foreboding presence, seeming all consuming the further in it goes.

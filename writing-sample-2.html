					<h5><u>Story:</u></h5>
					<p>
						Four ringing notes of church bells rang throughout the small bustling town. And on the outer edges, a cloaked man stopped and raised his head at the sound. Among the sparse crowd of moving travelers and merchant carts, the hooded figure stood still, and in the direction of the sound, the man raised a hanging lantern which hung on the end of a long staff; And only until the last echoing ring, did the man lower his right arm and continue on his way with the wanderers towards the heart of the town.<br><br>

						Yet it only took a few more moments for him to stop again. This time, through the veils of the passing mob, he found himself looking at another man on the side of the road kneeling, and beneath him—a cat, painfully clawing its way through the dirt, as if it desperately needed to be somewhere.<br><br>

						*<br><br>

						Within the warm blanket of the evening, two[VP1]  sets of arms reached up in the air. A small glowing fire hovered over the small heads of a boy and a cat. “Don’t mess with them like that!” the man said laughing, coming out of the front door. The man walked to one end of the deck to grab a lantern from around their home’s front porch and then, with his right hand, snapped with his fingers to make a magical fire to light it. His wife just smiled as her own wisp danced around her fingers, capturing the gaze of two pairs of widened eyes. “Don’t worry you,” his wife said, “I won’t let them get burned.” Their arms reached out again, but this time a different hand approached from above. The man plucked the dancing flame out from all of them with his left hand and carried the glow to the last lantern in his right. “It’s not them who I’m worried about,” the man said leaning in closer to them again. His wife smacked him lightly against his chest and then grabbed the arm of their son, quickly bringing him close between them. “Well without such fire, you might lose us in the dark!” she taunted, making another wisp out of magic in the palm of their son. Yet as the first ball was made, another one joined, and then another, until the entire porch was filled with small glowing flames. “I would never lose you like this, now would I?” the man said to the rest of the glowing faces, arms out reached. “I suppose you wouldn’t, would you?” the wife said, grinning as she snuffed the nearest flame.<br><br>

						*<br><br>

						The cloaked man made his way to the crouched man and the cat, his lantern clinking and clattering as he walked. The man on the ground looked up to the sound and when he saw the figure approaching, he warned, “Be careful! This cat’s injured.” Taking off his hood, the cloaked man revealed a kind yet tired face and then smiled, “It’s alright, I think I may be of some use.”<br><br>

						The man kneeled beside them both, moving the lantern into the darkness of his cloak. “Are you a healer?” the troubled man wondered. The man brought the lantern back out, this time faintly glowing. “I consider myself simply… an experienced hand,” he said sprinkling pale blue ashes onto the small, pained cat. And as the cat’s body began to relax and its eyes softened, the cloaked man ushered the cat, “Can you help me out and stand buddy?” The cat mewed, stretching its new[VP2]  body, and as quickly as it rose, it quickly leaped to run off. To his best attempt, the troubled man jumped up, reaching as the cat scurried around the corner but still coming short. With a sigh, the man leaned back and said, “Well… at least all is well and good,” and to express his gratitude, reached out his left hand out to offer assistance and said, “You need a hand?” The cloaked man looked briefly at the outstretched arm, paused and said, “Actually, I could use some help…” However, instead of accepting, the man pulled his cloak tighter and brought himself up with his staff, “…help finding something.”<br><br>

						*<br><br>

						“We’ll be off looking for someone to trade with us now!” his wife said with an outstretched wave on her right and keeping their son close on her left, who was waving as well. The man [VP3] smiled and hollered at the pair walking away, “Make sure you sell all the magic torches! I did a lot of research into those!” His wife, in response, lifted the strung-together metal rods around her neck and clinked them around with a confident look. The man sat down with a sigh and looked over to their cat, “A handful, isn’t she buddy?”<br><br>

						*<br><br>

						Five chimes of the church bells rang and the cloaked man, unable to get much information earlier, lowered his lantern once more and continued his exploration of the town. He moved with the soft rattling of his lantern believing he was alone, until a soft mew came from around the corner. “It’s you buddy, isn’t it?” the man asked. The cat, who he helped earlier, revealed himself, sitting down in front of him and meowing once more. “Are you here to help me look around?” The cat meowed, and jumped onto the wall beside the man, walking in the other direction but making sure to stop to look back. The man grinned and ushered, “Lead the way.”<br><br>

						The cat guided the man nine to ten blocks until the cat halted in front of a metal gate. Tucked in the corner of a small commercial area, the gate barred off to a scorched building whose walls now only stood half as tall. “This is it, isn't it?” the man said, using his staff to slowly push the rusted body of the gate open, and taking a few steps closer to the skeleton of the building. The cat mewed behind him, and the man glanced back to see the cat perfectly sitting in the opening. The man nodded saying, “Wait for me there, alright bud?” and then looked ahead as he prepared to step into the ashen tragedy before him.<br><br>

						*<br><br>

						The cat meowed and jumped up from the window by the front door of the cottage. And in response, the man looked up from the kitchen table and then quickly through the sunny windows outside. “They’re back early, aren’t they? Maybe they found a merchant cart…” the man said, making his way to the front door, but as he approached, he could hear the faint clinking of metal and then, soon after, a scream calling for him. At that sound, the man quickly lunged for the door, throwing it open.<br><br>

						His wife was covered in blood, limping her way towards the house. And in her arms, their son—motionless. The man leaped forward off the porch, meeting them before his wife would collapse. “What happened?!” the man screamed, embracing them both. Their son’s body was mangled, burn marks covering his left side, his entire arm missing. “We…we can save him,” his wife said, blood covering her face, tightly grasping both her son and the man, barely able to stand. “What are you talking about?” the man said shuddering, looking at their boy’s broken state. “We can save him,” she repeated with widened eyes, “The basement—our research.” The man hesitated, “But that… that’s not what…” His wife reached out with her stained right hand and brought it to the man’s face, “Please. There’s no time.” The man looked at their son again, painfully light in his arms. “Alright,” he said bracing them both.<br><br>

						*<br><br>

						The welcome bell still chimed as the man slowly pushed in the half standing door to the burned down shop. The black floorboards creaked, welcoming the new guest to the store long abandoned. “Pardon me for the intrusion,” the man said to the empty rooms, making his way further in. The only response being the dampened creaking of rusted metal and rubble of broken chairs and tables. The shop smelled  of ash, yet among the bulky smell of smoke were notes of sweetness, lightly radiating from the kitchen. The man weaved his way to the back until he stood alone, face to face with an iron hearth—still glowing from the embers within. “Found you…” the man said, putting down his staff and peering close into the barred belly of the stove. On his knees, the man opened the iron face to release the trapped heat, and inside a faint red flame still held onto a single ember, alone among the powdery charcoal around it.<br><br>

						The man took off his cloak to reach within—not with his right arm, but his left. The man’s left arm revealed a stump, missing the hand and scarred well into his forearm.  His stump began to delve into the heart of the oven, aiming closer to the softly dancing flame as if his hand were still there. And then, right before the stump would touch the ember, his arm stopped approaching and the flame stood still. Beginning to lift at the end of the man’s stump as if it were dancing on an invisible palm, the fire was pulled out until it exited the body of the hearth. “Don’t burn out on me yet,” the man said, moving the tiny flame to his lantern. The moment the flame touched the interior, the fire jumped and grew, becoming a bright blue color. Now with a lit lantern, the man stood up to the sound of 6 tolls of the church bells and pointed his staff in the direction of the sound once[VP4]  more. This time, however, the blue flame at the end began to dance wildly and the man smiled, “You won’t be lost any longer.”<br><br>

						*<br><br>

						The fire was out of control. Laying on his side, the man was knocked away from the magic circle that engulfed both his wife and their son. “STOP! STOP IT!” the man yelled, struggling to get close on the ground. His wife, however, continued to chant, grabbing her son tighter and tighter with every recital. The green fire wrapped around [VP5] the two small figures continued to grow with each second as well, roaring and tearing everything within the small basement. The man screamed for them to hear him, but he was but a mere observer to the increasing rampage of both the fire and his wife. Barely able to stand on his feet, the man reached one last time with his left hand into the seething circle, grasping onto his wife’s arm. She snapped up with widened tearful eyes, breaking her gaze with her son, and witnessed the storm around her. “STOP IT! PLEASE!” the man begged, clutching his one hand around his wife tighter. Yet the moment he and his wife locked eyes with each other, the man saw nothing but sorrow in her eyes, and even among the thunderous flame, he would hear the words she would mouth next clear as day—“I’m sorry.” And with those words, the lime fire tightened and scorched the ground, incinerating everything within its bounds. The man could do nothing but try to tighten his disintegrating arm [VP6] around his wife and son as they both, alongside his hand, fragmented into ash in front of him. And at the last wisp of ember, he screamed a call of despair ringing alone in the burned empty shell of their basement.<br><br>


						*<br><br>

						At seven rings, the man now stood near the base of the church, looking up but no longer lifting his staff. Alongside the warm glow from his lantern, the man was still accompanied by the cat, who still walked alongside him all this way. In the low light of the evening, they moved towards the fields of graves that filled the space around the small chapel. Scanning the rows of stones the man wandered with intention, holding his left arm up, towards the middle of the graveyard, which sang in silence alongside the visitor’s clattering pace.<br><br>


						*<br><br>


						There was nothing but complete stillness in the room. The man lay broken on his knees, his left arm, still held up, dripping blood onto the ashes beneath him. His tears joined the growing puddle below as he hunched forward, all pooling around his right hand which laid firmly planted in the still warm cinders. “I’ll find you,” the man said, gripping the damp mixture of ashes and bringing it in front of him, “I won’t lose you again.”<br><br>


						*<br><br>
						

						A lone stone archway stood in front of the cloaked man in the open field of graves at sunset. And with the mewing of the cat and the rattling of the staff, the man walked up and touched his lantern to the keystone, causing it to glow. While the opening of the arch started to fill with a glowing green haze, the man said with a tearful smile, “I’ve found you again.” The inside of the arch was now completely filled, with a glass-like mist creating a portal in the frame. And on the other side—the kind smile of the man’s wife was revealed, her figure, who also held a lantern in her right hand and a smaller figure on her left, stood waiting. [VP7] “I’m back dear,” the man said. And in response, his wife mouthed something, with no sound reaching his side. However, the man smiled even more, and then proceeded to kneel to see further past his wife. A small head peaked out from behind her and the man, expecting such a face, spoke once more, “Hey kiddo, I’ve brought your little friend again.” And as if responding to his call, the friended cat moved closer to the portal and then completely stepped in, his body scattered like ash[VP8]  as he joined the other side. “I could only keep you here for so long[VP9] , buddy,” the man said wistfully, standing back up. Now bringing both arms up and leaning his lantern closer to hers, the man presented the blue flame. “I’ve brought another,” he said, and his wife kindly accepted his offer with a smile, letting the fire jump from his lantern to hers[VP10].<br><br>

						And with a setting sun, the man further lifted his left arm to touch the portal, but as his stump leaned further and further across the other side, a faint glowing hand emerged in place of where his stump usually ended. The ethereal hand was met on the other side by the small left hand of his wife, bringing it close to cup her face. They both smiled as both mouthed the same words to each other. And with the fading light of the sun, so did the light of the portal begin to fade. But even so, the couple stood still as long as they could, and right before the last bit of glow disappeared, the man promised once more, “I’ll find you again soon.” And then, the light was gone, and the man stood alone with weeping eyes and an outstretched stump all over again.<br><br>
